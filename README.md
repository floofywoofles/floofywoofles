Hi, I am floofywoofles (Kevin). I am a programmer who primarily uses Python and Typescript, and PHP (only for jobs). I have used C and C++ before, but I am not an expert.
<br>
What projects I am currently working on:
<br>
1: My autocomplete engine WordComplete
<br>
2: Habitual, a habit tracking app to keep me sane
<br>

I also have experience in C++, C, and PHP. I did freelance work for Firith.studio, and made a website for a company.

<br>

If you have any questions, contact me at k.knapp.jr4@gmail.com

If you use Element, I am available at @floofywoofles
