Hi, I am floofywoofles (Kevin). I am a programmer who primarily uses Python and Typescript, and PHP (only for jobs). I have used C and C++ before, but I am not an expert.

What projects I am currently working on:
1: My autocomplete engine WordComplete
2: Habitual, a habit tracking app to keep me sane
3: Secret project
