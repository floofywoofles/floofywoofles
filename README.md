Hi, I am floofywoofles (Kevin). I am a programmer who primarily uses Python and Typescript, and PHP (only for jobs). I have used C and C++ before, but I am not an expert.
<br>
What projects I am currently working on:
<br>
1: My autocomplete engine WordComplete
<br>
2: Habitual, a habit tracking app to keep me sane
<br>
3: Secret project
