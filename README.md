## Hi, I am floofywoofles (Kevin Knapp) ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a backend developer who is unemployed, and lives in Ohio.

---

## What I specialize in
- Javascript/Typescript/Nodejs/Python
- NoSQL/SQL/MySQL/MongoDB/Redis
- Enough docker to get an app with other components running (database, caching db, etc.)
- Experience with Linux (Ubuntu,Fedora)

## Experience
I took a programming course in school for 4 years where I used Python, Java, Unity (C#), and HTML/CSS (Web Design) on school projects. However, none of those projects are saved anywhere due to rules that the school had set in place.  
I learned other programming languages outside of school like typescript, C, C++, and I did a freelance job that involved NodeJS, expressjs, MongoDB, and Axios.

## Current Projects
I am working on a simple CLI todo-app and my own interpreted programming language.
